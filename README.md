Your actual Course Project and user manual are due at the end of Week 7. However, it is strongly recommended that you start your project in Week 5 to avoid any last minute issues.

In Week 7, you will be required to submit a user manual, as well as your Java code. The user manual can be a simple Word document with screen shots that explains how to run your application. Your mark will depend both on the program quality and the quality of the user manual.

Here are some more detailed guidelines about the user manual.

<ul>

 <li>It does not need to be long, probably not more than five pages, including screen shots.</li>

 <li>Write at the expected user’s level, not too technical.</li>

 <li>Detail all the functionality that the application provides.</li>

 <li>For each function, show what its purpose is and sample execution, with a screen shot.</li>

</ul>
